## üåç About the app
Astrale is an astrology mobile application programmed with **React Native** (JavaScript) using **Expo** platform and **React Paper** for styling.

It comes with **texts in both English and Spanish**.

As it is right now is only published in Android, as Apple is not accepting more Astrology apps, but it is programmed and tested for both platforms.

- Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=josep.astrale

There are some files omitted because they contain sensitive information, if you want to clone the repository and test it locally, you must rename `un_app.json` to `app.json` and `src/credentials/un_admob.js` to `admob.js`.

## ü§ñ Behind the scenes
A good astrology application needs new data for each day and for each sign soooo... Python scraper to the rescue:
- THE DATA: It comes from a [**scraper programmed with Python**](https://github.com/jvidalv/python-vv-scrapers) that each day at midnight goes to astrology pages in spanish and english for the data.
- THE SAFE: The data that python extracts **its saved in a NoSQL DB, Mongo**.
- THE CONNECTOR: A [**PHP backend**](https://github.com/jvidalv/vvadmin) **with an API REST** that serves the data to the application.
- THE DIRECTOR: All the process commented, deploys, testings... Are **orchestrated with Jenkins pipelines and projects**.
