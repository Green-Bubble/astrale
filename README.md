## ü§ñ Behind the scenes
A good astrology application needs new data for each day and for each sign soooo... Python scraper to the rescue:
- THE DATA: It comes from a [**scraper programmed with Python**](https://github.com/jvidalv/python-vv-scrapers) that each day at midnight goes to astrology pages in spanish and english for the data.
- THE SAFE: The data that python extracts **its saved in a NoSQL DB, Mongo**.
- THE CONNECTOR: A [**PHP backend**](https://github.com/jvidalv/vvadmin) **with an API REST** that serves the data to the application.
- THE DIRECTOR: All the process commented, deploys, testings... Are **orchestrated with Jenkins pipelines and projects**.
